Practice of Unit Testing and e2e testing with Cypress

I used the calculator react project to practice Unit testing and End2End testing using cypress. 

I learned 
- the importance of accuratly labeling elements with apporpriate id's as these are important in testing. 
- how to use cypress and the time and cost it can take for good e2e testing.
